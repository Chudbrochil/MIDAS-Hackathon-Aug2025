# Project 2: Computer Vision for City Planning in Detroit

## Overview

This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to analyze Detroit's urban landscape using historical and contemporary imagery (1999â€“2024) combined with GIS data. The goal is to build tools that enhance city planning capabilities and improve the accuracy of property-level data throughout Detroit.

## Problem Statement

Detroit faces significant challenges in maintaining accurate property assessments and urban planning data:
- **Manual verification processes** are time-intensive and resource-heavy
- **Outdated building habitability assessments** compromise public safety
- **Inaccurate housing unit counts** affect census data and resource allocation
- **Limited automation** in property condition monitoring

## Goals

Create computer vision models and tools to:

### Building Habitability Assessment
- **Identify uninhabitable structures** from aerial and street-level imagery
- **Classify building conditions** across safety and habitability metrics
- **Prioritize inspection resources** based on automated risk assessment
- **Track changes over time** using multi-temporal imagery analysis

### Property Data Enhancement
- **Improve base unit accuracy** for multi-family buildings
- **Assist with census audits** by validating housing unit counts
- **Automate property characteristic detection** (building materials, roof condition, lot usage)
- **Support zoning and land use planning** with updated property classifications

### Predictive Modeling and Automation
- **Streamline manual verification** through automated pre-screening
- **Reduce inspection costs** by targeting high-priority properties
- **Provide early warning systems** for deteriorating building conditions
- **Enable data-driven policy decisions** with accurate property intelligence

## Technical Approach

### Data Sources
- **Historical imagery**: Detroit aerial and satellite imagery (1999-2024)
- **Street-level imagery**: Google Street View, municipal inspection photos
- **GIS data**: Property boundaries, zoning information, building footprints
- **Administrative records**: Permit data, violation history, ownership records

### Computer Vision Models
- **Object detection**: Identify buildings, structures, and property features
- **Classification models**: Assess building condition and habitability status  
- **Segmentation**: Precise building boundary detection and land use classification
- **Change detection**: Temporal analysis to track property condition evolution

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature extraction**: Automated identification of relevant building characteristics
- **Multi-modal fusion**: Combine imagery with GIS and administrative data
- **Model validation**: Ground-truth comparison with inspection records
- **Scalable deployment**: Production-ready inference for city-wide analysis

## Expected Impact

### For City Officials
- **Enhanced inspection efficiency**: Target resources to highest-risk properties
- **Improved data accuracy**: Better foundation for policy and planning decisions
- **Cost reduction**: Automated pre-screening reduces manual workload
- **Public safety**: Earlier identification of dangerous structures

### For Urban Planning
- **Accurate housing inventory**: Reliable data for demographic and economic analysis
- **Development insights**: Understanding of neighborhood change patterns
- **Resource allocation**: Data-driven distribution of city services and investments
- **Policy evaluation**: Quantitative assessment of intervention effectiveness

### For Research and Community
- **Academic research**: High-quality dataset for urban studies
- **Community engagement**: Transparent, data-driven neighborhood assessments
- **Grant applications**: Evidence base for funding proposals
- **Historical analysis**: Long-term trends in urban development

## Technical Deliverables

1. **Computer vision models** for building condition assessment
2. **Automated processing pipeline** for imagery analysis
3. **Integration tools** for GIS and administrative data
4. **Web interface** for city staff to access results
5. **API endpoints** for integration with existing city systems
6. **Documentation and training** materials for city personnel

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >90% agreement with manual inspections on habitability assessments
- **Coverage**: City-wide analysis capability for all Detroit properties
- **Efficiency**: 10x reduction in time required for property condition surveys
- **Cost savings**: Measurable reduction in inspection and verification costs
- **Adoption**: Integration into existing city planning workflows
