Raw notes;



Derek

- Just because something is blighted doesn't mean it's uninhabited.

- Detroit has street view data.
-- Q: Is this joinable?





one parcel can have multiple units

Blight labels

vacant, not blighted

slightly blighted?

significantly blighted

extreme blighted


The blight data is only for properties that are for vacant lots...


Keerthana:
- We want to get more blight rather than less, because we can shortlist these afterwards.
- Recall is more important.


Issue with problem:
- Time is a an issue because we are joining against multiple field surveys.
-- Potential solution: Take only last survey


# Non-occupied blight, data distribution shift.




# Technical Risks
- Time series data, difficult to predict against without making time series models.
-- Need to do filtering or discretization (i.e. <1yr, <2yr)

- #1 Duplication of data based on surveys, permits issued, usps vacancy checks, water status checks.

- #2 Deduplication of addresses/units per parcel ID
-- You have to consider the determination per unit vs. per parcel, they might be very different.

- Data distribution shift of labels.
-- The blight survey only does vacant homes, but we want to predict against all of them.
