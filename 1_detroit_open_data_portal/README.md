# Project 1: Improving Search and Interaction in Detroit's Open Data Portal

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing user experience within Detroit's Open Data Portal, which houses over 200 datasets spanning multiple city departments. The current system presents challenges for both residents and researchers in navigating and interpreting this wealth of municipal information.

## Problem Statement

Detroit's Open Data Portal contains valuable information across numerous city departments, but users struggle with:
- Finding relevant datasets among 200+ available options
- Understanding dataset relationships and metadata
- Accessing information in natural, intuitive ways
- Bridging the gap between technical data and practical citizen needs

## Goals

Develop a natural language chatbot and search enhancement system that enables:

### For Residents
- **Localized, service-oriented data access**: Easy discovery of information relevant to their neighborhood and daily needs
- **Intuitive querying**: Natural language interface for finding city services, neighborhood statistics, and municipal information
- **Simplified data interpretation**: User-friendly presentation of complex municipal datasets

### For Researchers
- **Cross-departmental insights**: Ability to discover relationships between datasets across different city departments
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Sophisticated querying tools for academic and policy research
- **Data integration support**: Tools to help combine and analyze multiple related datasets

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Synonym Recognition**: Improve search accuracy by understanding various ways users might refer to the same concepts
2. **Enhanced Metadata Mapping**: Better organization and categorization of datasets for improved discoverability
3. **Modular Design**: Flexible architecture that can adapt to different use cases and user types
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure all interactions respect privacy guidelines and data protection requirements
5. **Infrastructure Alignment**: Design solutions that integrate well with existing technical systems

## Success Metrics

- Improved user engagement with open data resources
- Reduced time to find relevant datasets
- Increased cross-departmental data usage
- Positive feedback from both resident and researcher user groups
- Successful integration with existing portal infrastructure

## Technical Approach

The solution will leverage:
- Natural language processing for query understanding
- Semantic search capabilities for better dataset matching
- User interface enhancements for improved accessibility
- API design for seamless integration with existing systems

## Impact

This project aims to democratize access to Detroit's municipal data, supporting both civic engagement and evidence-based research that can inform policy and community development initiatives.
