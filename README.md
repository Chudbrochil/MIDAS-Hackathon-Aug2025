# MIDAS Hackathon - AI for Social Good Projects

This repository contains three AI projects developed for the MIDAS Hackathon, focused on applying machine learning and AI technologies to address real-world challenges in Detroit.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Project 1: Improving Search and Interaction in Detroit's Open Data Portal
**Directory**: `1_detroit_open_data_portal/`

Natural language chatbot and search enhancement for Detroit's Open Data Portal, enabling intuitive exploration of 200+ city datasets for residents and researchers.

### Project 2: Computer Vision for City Planning in Detroit
**Directory**: `2_detroit_computer_vision/`

Computer vision tools using Detroit imagery (1999–2024) and GIS data to assess building habitability and enhance property-level data accuracy.

### Project 3: Flood and Erosion Risk Policy Analysis Tool
**Directory**: `3_detroit_flood_risk_analysis/`

Interactive policy modeling tool for Detroit's resilience planning, supporting flood and erosion risk analysis under various policy scenarios.
