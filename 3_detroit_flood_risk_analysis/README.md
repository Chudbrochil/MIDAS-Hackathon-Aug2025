# Project 3: Detroit Flood Risk Policy Analysis

## Project Description

Interactive flood/erosion risk policy tool inspired by En-ROADS. This project aims to develop an interactive policy modeling platform for flood and erosion risk analysis, enabling stakeholders to explore outcomes of different policy interventions through data-driven scenario analysis.

**Key Goals**:
- Enable policy intervention simulation for flood mitigation strategies
- Support stakeholder decision-making with evidence-based projections
- Provide interactive interface for exploring climate/policy scenarios
- Integrate Great Lakes-specific data and regional climate patterns

## Current Challenges

Detroit faces increasing climate risks requiring tools to:
- Evaluate policy effectiveness before implementation
- Model complex interactions between climate factors and urban infrastructure
- Support long-term resilience planning for Great Lakes region challenges
- Enable collaborative planning across multiple stakeholders

## Potential Technical Approach

**Potential Tech Stack**: LLM integration for scenario generation, hydrological modeling, geospatial analysis, interactive web platform, policy modeling frameworks

**Planned Features**:
- Natural language policy queries and scenario exploration
- Interactive dashboard with drag-and-drop policy tools
- Multi-scale analysis (neighborhood to city-wide to regional)
- Real-time visualization of policy intervention outcomes
- Integration with Great Lakes water level and climate data
