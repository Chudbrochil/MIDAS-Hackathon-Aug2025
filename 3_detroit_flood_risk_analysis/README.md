# Project 3: Flood and Erosion Risk Policy Analysis Tool

## Overview

Inspired by interactive policy tools like En-ROADS, this project aims to support Detroit's resilience planning by developing a comprehensive modeling platform for flood and erosion risks. The tool enables stakeholders to explore the outcomes of different policy interventions through data-driven scenario analysis.

## Problem Statement

Detroit faces increasing climate risks, particularly related to flooding and erosion, requiring sophisticated tools to:
- **Evaluate policy effectiveness** before implementation
- **Model complex interactions** between climate factors and urban infrastructure  
- **Support stakeholder decision-making** with evidence-based projections
- **Plan long-term resilience strategies** for Great Lakes region challenges

## Goals

Develop an interactive policy analysis platform that:

### Scenario Modeling
- **Policy intervention simulation**: Model outcomes of various flood mitigation strategies
- **Climate scenario analysis**: Incorporate different climate change projections
- **Infrastructure impact assessment**: Evaluate effects on existing city infrastructure
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Quantify economic implications of policy choices

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Interactive interface**: User-friendly platform for exploring policy scenarios
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate visualization of policy intervention outcomes
- **Collaborative planning**: Multi-stakeholder access for coordinated decision-making
- **Educational tools**: Help users understand complex climate-policy relationships

### Data Integration
- **Great Lakes-specific data**: Incorporate regional water level and weather patterns
- **Detroit infrastructure data**: Include city-specific flood vulnerability information
- **Historical analysis**: Learn from past flood events and policy responses
- **Predictive modeling**: Generate forward-looking risk assessments

## Technical Architecture

### LLM-Based Scenario Analysis
- **Natural language queries**: Allow stakeholders to explore scenarios using plain English
- **Policy interpretation**: Automatically translate policy descriptions into model parameters
- **Narrative generation**: Create human-readable summaries of complex model outputs
- **What-if exploration**: Support iterative policy testing and refinement

### Hydrological Modeling
- **Flood risk simulation**: Model water flow and accumulation patterns
- **Erosion prediction**: Assess long-term shoreline and infrastructure erosion
- **Storm water management**: Evaluate green infrastructure and drainage solutions
- **Climate integration**: Incorporate precipitation and temperature projections

### Great Lakes Data Integration
- **Water level monitoring**: Real-time and historical Great Lakes water levels
- **Weather pattern analysis**: Regional climate data and extreme weather events
- **Seasonal variation modeling**: Account for ice cover, seasonal storms, and temperature cycles
- **Regional connectivity**: Consider impacts from other Great Lakes cities and policies

## Key Features

### Interactive Policy Dashboard
- **Drag-and-drop policy tools**: Easy configuration of intervention scenarios
- **Real-time visualization**: Immediate feedback on policy effectiveness
- **Comparison views**: Side-by-side analysis of different policy combinations
- **Export capabilities**: Generate reports and presentations for stakeholders

### Multi-Scale Analysis
- **Neighborhood-level detail**: Fine-grained analysis for specific Detroit communities
- **City-wide planning**: Comprehensive assessment of metropolitan interventions
- **Regional coordination**: Great Lakes basin-wide policy coordination tools
- **Time horizon flexibility**: Short-term (5-year) to long-term (50-year) projections

### Stakeholder Tools
- **Role-specific interfaces**: Customized views for city planners, residents, and researchers
- **Collaborative workspaces**: Shared scenario development and analysis
- **Public engagement features**: Community input and feedback mechanisms
- **Educational resources**: Tutorials and documentation for non-technical users

## Expected Outcomes

### For City Officials
- **Evidence-based policy decisions**: Quantitative support for resilience investments
- **Resource optimization**: Identify most cost-effective flood mitigation strategies
- **Risk communication**: Clear visualization tools for public and council presentations
- **Long-term planning**: Strategic roadmaps for climate adaptation

### For Community Stakeholders
- **Transparent planning process**: Open access to policy analysis and projections
- **Local impact understanding**: Neighborhood-specific flood risk information
- **Policy advocacy**: Tools to evaluate and promote community resilience priorities
- **Educational engagement**: Improved understanding of climate risks and solutions

### For Regional Coordination
- **Great Lakes collaboration**: Shared tools for regional resilience planning
- **Best practice sharing**: Platform for comparing successful interventions
- **Research integration**: Academic research incorporation into practical planning
- **Policy harmonization**: Coordination tools for multi-jurisdictional initiatives

## Technical Deliverables

1. **Interactive web platform** with policy scenario modeling capabilities
2. **LLM integration** for natural language policy queries and narrative generation
3. **Hydrological modeling engine** with Great Lakes-specific parameters
4. **Data integration pipeline** for real-time and historical climate data
5. **Visualization dashboard** with maps, charts, and scenario comparison tools
6. **API framework** for integration with existing city planning systems
7. **User documentation** and training materials for stakeholders
